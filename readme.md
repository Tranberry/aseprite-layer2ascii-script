# Aseprite Layers to ASCII Script

This is a script for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a pixel art editor, that converts each layer of a sprite to an ASCII text file.

## Installation

1. Download the `layer2ASCII.lua` file.
2. Open Aseprite and navigate to `File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder`.
3. Place the `layer2ASCII.lua` file in this folder.

## Usage

1. Open the sprite you want to convert to ASCII.
2. Navigate to `File > Scripts > layer2ASCII`.
3. Wait for the script to finish running.
4. For each layer in the sprite, there will be a corresponding text file in the same folder as the sprite.

Note that the script uses incremental symbols for each pixel. The output text files will contain the ASCII symbols corresponding to the colors in each layer of the sprite.

Enjoy!
